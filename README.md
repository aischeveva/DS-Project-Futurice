# Data Science Project Futurice 2019
This project is part of the course CS-C3230 Data Science Project at Aalto University. Collaborated with and mentored by Futurice Oy. 

**Project Topic**: Is it possible to extract market trends automatically from the published data?
For a consulting company like Futurice, it is important to understand emerging business trends and the market situation of client companies. 

The data we have available is from the [Edgar database](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) in form of annual reports (10-K format). The data source contains the annual financial report of all registered companies in the USA. 

**Our task**: 
- Explore publicly available textual financial datasets using Machine Learning methods. 
- Create visualizations to highlight the most important trends in the data.
