through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for and respectively of total net sales the company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products and services are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products the company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high quality sales and after sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers to ensure a high quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized the company continues to build and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide the company s retail stores are typically located at high traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts by operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high traffic locations the company is better positioned to ensure a high quality customer buying experience and attract new customers the stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the company s products and related solutions the retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice service and training and offer a wide selection of third party hardware software and other accessories that complement the company s products the company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality apple fixtures merchandising materials and other resources within selected third party reseller locations through the apple premium reseller program certain third party resellers focus on the apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise integration and support

information technology environments the company s products are compatible with thousands of third party business applications and services and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration no single customer accounted for more than of net sales in and competitionthe markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices many of the company s competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures the company s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry wide downward pressures on gross margins principal competitive factors important to the company include price product and service features including security features relative price and performance product and service quality and reliability design innovation a strong third party software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices these markets are highly competitive and include many large well funded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the company s products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these markets are characterized by aggressive price competition frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses apple inc form k the company s services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications the company s future financial condition and operating results depend on the company s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware ios devices mac apple watch and apple tv software ios macos watchos and tvos online services and distribution of digital content and applications digital content and services some of the company s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company s offerings supply of componentsalthough most components essential to the company s business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources in addition the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results substantially all of the company s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia with some mac computers manufactured in the u s and ireland a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are single sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the company s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to days research and developmentbecause the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through r d licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third party businesses and technology intellectual propertythe company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services this includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the u s and a number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel apple inc form k the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others the company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the company s products the company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products many of the company s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the company s products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company s products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties foreign and domestic operations and geographic dataduring the company s domestic and international net sales accounted for and respectively of total net sales gross margins on the company s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties business seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the company s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company s future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance warrantythe company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end user the company also offers a day limited warranty on the service parts used to repair the company s hardware products in certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute typically at least two years in addition where available consumers may purchase app or ac which extends service coverage on many of the company s hardware products backlogin the company s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance employeesas of september the company had approximately full time equivalent employees apple inc form k available informationthe company s annual reports on form k

should be read in conjunction with part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of this form k the business financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company s business financial condition operating results and stock price because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company s business results of operations financial condition and growth the company has international operations with sales outside the u s representing a majority of the company s total net sales in addition a majority of the company s supply chain and its manufacturing and assembly activities are located outside the u s as a result the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in addition consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors in addition to an adverse impact on demand for the company s products uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the company s suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the company s products and insolvency a downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the company s trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the company s ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the company s financial instruments these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the company s business results of operations financial condition and growth global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns and the company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected apple inc form k the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone tablet and personal computer markets the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships in addition some of the company s competitors have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed base of active devices competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss additionally the company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions some of the markets in which the company competes including the market for personal computers have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted in addition an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the company s existing products the company s services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third party digital content and applications the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services the success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its retail and online stores some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products apple inc form k the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value the company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company reviews long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value although the company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable no assurance can be given that the company will not incur write downs fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments manufacturing purchase obligations cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms because the company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company s business results of operations financial condition and growth above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements if the company s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on single sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes apple inc form k the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company s business and result in harm to the company s reputation the company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products defects may also exist in components and products the company purchases from third parties component defects could make the company s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury these risks may increase as the company s products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare in addition the company s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors as a result the company s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the company s products and services in addition the company may be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications write offs of inventory property plant and equipment and or intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the company s products and services and result in harm to the company s reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and services introductions and lost revenue the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers this includes the right to sell currently available music movies tv shows and books the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make third party digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the company s products compared to competitors platforms such as android for smartphones and tablets and windows for personal computers this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services apple inc form k the company s minority market share in the global smartphone tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors products with larger market share if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s devices may suffer the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products the company s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers the company sells and delivers third party applications for its products through the app store mac app store and tv app store the company retains a commission from sales through these platforms if developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in app purchases to customers then the volume of sales and the commission that the company earns on those sales would decrease the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future in addition agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party claims against the company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase in particular the company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular enabled products and new claims may arise in the future for example technology and other patent holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes no assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these agreements may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses except as described in part ii item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise apple inc form k the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities in areas including but not limited to labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy and data localization requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a majority of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy and data localization requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur in some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company s brand international growth efforts and business the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs political instability and international trade disputes gross margins on the company s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the company s retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs the company s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the company s financial condition and operating results including macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity other factors include but are not limited to the company s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost apple inc form k investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the company s business by among other things preventing access to the company s online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company s products these events could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results there may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information pii with respect to the company s customers and employees the company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results the company s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties although the company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results for example the company may experience a security breach impacting the company s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information such an incident could among other things impair the company s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the company s stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the company although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies as with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company s products and services in addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data health data may be subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the company s compliance with these obligations if the company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the company s agreements with healthcare institutions the company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines apple inc form k under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards the company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results while the company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others in addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on the company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners international trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the company s business tariffs could increase the cost of the company s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them these increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the company earns on its products tariffs could also make the company s products more expensive for customers which could make the company s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the company s ability to offer its products and services political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the company s business many of the company s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the company s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters in addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond the company s control global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects such events could make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the company s service offerings following an interruption to its business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations and lose significant revenue because the company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the company apple inc form k the company s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers while the company s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company s business and harm to the company s reputation should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s suppliers and contract manufacturers the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels for example gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the company sells shifts in the geographic currency or channel mix of the company s sales component cost increases price competition or the introduction of new products including new products with higher cost structures the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses further the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales the company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar relative to local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide gross margins on the company s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the u s dollar s strengthening which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the gross margins the company earns on foreign currency denominated sales conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place apple inc form k the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results market and economic conditions political risk sovereign risk interest rate fluctuations or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the u s and ireland the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the u s internal revenue service the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if the company s effective tax rates were to increase particularly

sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the u s and for certain other sales the company defers revenue

cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management s estimates are

sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other than temporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this determination the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company s intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company

company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized

together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to recover the company s deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance and a corresponding charge to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results on december the u s enacted the act which significantly changed u s tax law the act lowered the company s u s statutory federal income tax rate from to effective january while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings the impact of the act increased the company s provision for income taxes by billion during this increase was composed of billion related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and billion associated with the deemed repatriation tax partially offset by a billion impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the company s unrecognized tax benefits certain amounts reported by the company related to the act are provisional estimates in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no resolution of the act s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results legal and other contingenciesas discussed in part i item of this form k under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment except as described in part ii item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and contingencies under the heading contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate and foreign currency risk managementthe company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results interest rate riskthe company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in u s interest rates changes in u s interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company s debt the company s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the company s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september and september a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a billion and billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity apple inc form k as of september and september the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of billion and billion respectively the company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument a basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company s debt as of september and september to increase by million and million on an annualized basis respectively further details regarding the company s debt is provided in part ii item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note debt foreign currency riskin general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u s dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the u s dollar will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in u s dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries in addition the company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency denominated debt issuances the company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september compared to a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the company s actual exposures and positions apple inc form k item financial statements and supplementary dataindex to

company s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the u s and for certain other sales the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit for payment terms in excess of the company s standard payment terms revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable such as a successful history of collection
