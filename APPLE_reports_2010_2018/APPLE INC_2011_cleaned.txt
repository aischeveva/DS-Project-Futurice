support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers to ensure a high quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized the company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide additionally the company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality apple fixtures merchandising materials and other resources within selected third party reseller locations through the apple premium reseller program certain third party resellers focus on the apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services and product expertise no single customer accounted for more than of net sales in or one of the company s customers accounted for of net sales in competition the markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices the company s competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share the company s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry wide downward pressures on gross margins principal competitive factors important to the company include price product features relative price performance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong third party software and peripherals ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to mobile communication and media devices these industries are highly competitive and include several large well funded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these industries to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the company s products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these industries are characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses the company s digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peer to peer music and video services the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware iphone ipad mac and ipod software itunes and distribution of digital content and applications itunes store app store ibookstore and mac app store some of the company s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company s offerings the company s future financial condition and operating results depend on the company s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets it competes in supply of components although most components essential to the company s business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks many components are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations in addition the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company and other participants in the mobile communication and media device and personal computer industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements substantially all of the company s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners primarily located in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole sourced suppliers of components and manufacturer for many of the company s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company s purchase commitments typically cover the company s requirements for periods up to days research and development because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through research and development licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third party businesses and technology total research and development expense was billion billion and billion in and respectively patents trademarks copyrights and licenses the company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its iphone ipad mac and ipod devices peripherals software and services the company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the u s and a number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel the company regularly files patent applications to protect inventions arising from its research and development and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents in the u s and worldwide the company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the company s products the company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products due to the fast pace of innovation and product development the company s products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted many of the company s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods based upon past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties foreign and domestic operations and geographic data the u s represents the company s largest geographic market approximately of the company s net sales in came from sales to customers inside the u s final assembly of the company s products is currently performed in the company s manufacturing facility in ireland and by outsourcing partners primarily located in asia the supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe single sourced outsourcing partners in asia perform final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in part ii item and item of this form k and in notes to consolidated financial statements in note segment information and geographic data seasonal business the company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to increased holiday seasonal demand this historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company s future net sales or financial performance warranty the company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end user the company also offers a day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the company s hardware products in addition consumers may purchase the app which extends service coverage on many of the company s hardware products in most of its major markets backlog in the company s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance employees as of september the company had approximately full time equivalent employees and an additional full time equivalent temporary employees and contractors available information the company s annual report on form k quarterly reports on form q current

inactive textual references only item a risk factors because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company the company s operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in response to tighter credit unemployment negative financial news and or declines in income or asset values which could have a material negative effect on demand for the company s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company s expectations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u s to offset the effect of a strengthening of the u s dollar other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services and the company s financial condition and operating results in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company s products and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments interest rates cash balances and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change if the company is unable to compete effectively in these markets its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting with resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in research and development and as such the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks by contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third party digital content and applications the company has entered the mobile communications and media device markets and some of its competitors in these markets have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using mac os x which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and peripherals the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its financial condition and operating results the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes such charges could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts open orders and where appropriate inventory component prepayments in each case based on projected demand such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments the company s financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the company s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all the follow on effects from the credit crisis on the company s suppliers referred to in economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods as compared to levels achieved during largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and potential future component cost and other cost increases the company and other participants in the mobile communication and media device and personal computer industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements if the supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of whom are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners primarily located in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects the company also relies on its partners to adhere to the company s supplier code of conduct any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability whether pursuant to arrangements with outsourcing partners or otherwise or material violations of the supplier code of conduct could materially adversely affect the company s reputation financial condition and operating results the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe single sourced outsourcing partners in asia perform final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products if manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company relies on third party intellectual property and digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms or at all if the company is unable to obtain or renew critical licenses on reasonable terms its financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected the company also contracts with third parties to offer their digital content through the itunes store the licensing arrangements with these third parties are short term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content if the company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach the company s financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected many third party content providers require the company to provide digital rights management drm and other security solutions if these requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the company to license its drm which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is found to have infringed on intellectual property rights technology companies including many of the company s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as the company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase in particular the company s cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in europe and asia the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or the merits of any patent claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents it may be required to pay substantial damages if there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the company requiring it to pay royalties to a third party its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses in management s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated continued acceptance by customers of mac os x and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the company s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store the absence of multiple distribution channels which are available for competing platforms may limit the availability and acceptance of third party applications by the company s customers thereby causing developers to reduce or curtail development for the ios platform in addition ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the company s products rather than its competitors products including devices that use competing platforms if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s devices may suffer the company s future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through wholesalers resellers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells many of its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education customers cellular network carriers distribution channels resellers and consumers through its online and retail stores carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users purchase of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens if resellers stopped distributing the company s products or if uncertainty regarding demand for the company s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company s retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail segment a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation inability to sell third party products at adequate margins failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel partners more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost investment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated the company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful they may materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results the company s products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue harm to reputation and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to areas of labor advertising content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of the device locking the device to a carrier s network or mandating the use of the device on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications delays in product shipment dates or preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance this increases the costs of doing business and any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions cause the company to change or limit its business practices or affect the company s financial condition and operating results the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its ceo its executive team and highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in the silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other circumstances could materially adversely affect the company war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a strong negative effect on the company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners the company s business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control such events could decrease demand for the company s products make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the company s supply chain should major public health issues including pandemics arise the company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers the majority of the company s research and development activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters in

may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions that could damage the company s reputation business operations and financial conditions the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or similar events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all

or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting the company may be subject to breaches of its information technology systems which could damage the company s reputation business partner and customer relationships and access to online stores and services such breaches could subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information pii this may include names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company may be at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii managed the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data these security measures may be compromised as a result of third party security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularity and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security the company may experience a breach of its systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data moreover if a computer security breach affects the company s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company s reputation and brand could be materially damaged and use of the company s products and services could decrease the company would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business results of operations and financial condition the company s business is subject to a variety of u s and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection the company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of pii in many cases these laws apply not only to third party transactions but also to transfers of information between the company and its subsidiaries and among the company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the company has commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability the company s privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on its website any failure by the company its suppliers or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policies or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business results of operations and financial condition the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix new products component cost increases strengthening u s dollar or price competition the company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first fiscal quarter compared to other fiscal quarters due to increased holiday seasonal demand furthermore the company sells more products from time to time during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock continues to experience substantial price volatility additionally the stock market as a whole has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance the company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations if the company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur the consequences of such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results the company s financial condition and operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs political instability and changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance it can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar will adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally will lead the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products in some circumstances due to competition or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company has used derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio although the company has not recognized any significant losses to date on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities any significant declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a significant impairment which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and value added resellers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited cellular network carriers accounted for a significant portion of the company s trade receivables as of september the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company two vendors accounted for a significant portion of the company s non trade receivables as of september in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the company the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary conduct of business and additional claims may arise in the future results of legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty and regardless of the merit of the claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results changes in the company s tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect its future results the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions the company s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability the company is also subject to the continual examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities the company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results item b unresolved staff comments none item properties the company s headquarters are located in cupertino

for various purposes the company believes its existing facilities and equipment are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business the company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors and continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products item legal proceedings as of september the end of the annual period covered by this report the company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected see the risk factors the company s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is found to have infringed on intellectual property rights and unfavorable results of legal

on march the northeast coast of japan experienced a severe earthquake followed by a tsunami with continuing aftershocks these geological events have caused significant damage in the region including severe damage to nuclear power plants and have impacted japan s power and other infrastructure as well as its economy certain of the company s suppliers are located in japan and certain of its other suppliers integrate components or use materials manufactured in japan in the production of its products to the extent that component production has been affected the company has generally obtained alternative sources of supply or implemented other measures the company does not currently believe these events will have a material impact on its operations in the first quarter of unless conditions worsen including but not limited to power outages and expansion of evacuation zones around the nuclear power plants beyond the first quarter of uncertainty exists with respect to the availability of electrical power the damage to nuclear power plants and the impact to other infrastructure thus there is a risk that the company could in the future experience delays or other constraints in obtaining key components and products and or price increases related to such components and products that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results in addition in recent months several regions of thailand have experienced severe flooding causing damage to infrastructure housing and factories a number of the company s suppliers are located in thailand as with japan to the extent that component production has been affected the company will work to obtain alternative sources of supply or implement other measures based on the company s current assessment of the situation it does not believe this event will have a material impact on its operations in the first quarter of however because the situation in thailand is still evolving uncertainty remains regarding the ultimate impact of this event on the company critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company s management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material management believes the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications peripherals and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the u s and for certain other sales the company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware for multi element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product s functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product s essential software and undelivered non software services the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe ii third party evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of the selling price esp vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esps reflect the company s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis for sales of iphone ipad apple tv for sales of ipod touch beginning in june and for sales of mac beginning in june the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers in june the company announced it would begin providing various non software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these unspecified software upgrade rights or the non software services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company s esps amounts allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated lives of each of these devices which range from to months the company s process for determining esps involves management s judgment the company s process considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable if the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non software services or the estimated lives of the related devices or should future facts and circumstances lead the company to consider additional factors the company s esp for software upgrades and non software services related to future sales of these devices could change if the estimated life of one or more of the devices should change the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade rights would also change the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs including reseller and end user rebates and other sales programs and volume based incentives for transactions involving price protection the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the company s policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for customer incentive programs the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have a negative impact on the company s results of operations valuation and impairment of marketable securities the company s investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the company s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of available for sale securities impact the company s net income only when such securities are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other than temporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company s intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the its amortized cost basis the company s assessment on whether a security is other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments the company records a write down for inventories of components and products including third party products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes if future demand or market conditions for the company s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory the company may be required to record additional write downs which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write downs were recorded the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information these commitments typically cover the company s requirements for periods up to days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company s typical experience each quarter the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the company s results of operations income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i item of this form k under the heading legal proceedings and in note commitments and contingencies in notes to consolidated financial statements the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected net sales fiscal years and each spanned weeks an additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter

favorable sales mix of iphone which had a higher gross margin than the company average the company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods as compared to levels achieved during largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and potential future component cost and other cost increases the foregoing statements regarding the company s expected gross margin percentage are forward looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of

pressures the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products due to the company s significant international operations financial results can be significantly

products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company which typically covers periods up to days the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information as of september the company had outstanding off balance sheet third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of billion other obligations other outstanding obligations were billion as of september and were comprised mainly of commitments under long term supply agreements to make additional inventory component prepayments and to acquire capital equipment commitments to acquire product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and commitments related to advertising research and development internet and telecommunications services and other obligations the company s other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties as of september the company had non current deferred tax liabilities of billion additionally as of september the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of billion and an additional million for gross interest and penalties classified as non current liabilities at this time the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table indemnification the company generally does not indemnify end users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third party however the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third party in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third party intellectual property rights the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either september or september the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim however the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition timing of gains and losses related to these instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results interest rate risk while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in u s interest rates changes in u s interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging the company s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company a portion of the company s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks the company s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the company s investment policy generally requires investments to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of september a similar basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity foreign currency risk in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u s dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the u s dollar will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in u s dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries generally the company s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to six months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september compared to a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company s actual exposures and positions item financial statements and supplementary data index to consolidated financial statements

years during the first quarter of the company adopted the financial accounting standard board s fasb new accounting standard on consolidation of variable interest entities this new accounting standard eliminates the mandatory quantitative approach in determining control for evaluating whether variable interest entities need to be consolidated in favor of a qualitative analysis and requires an ongoing reassessment of control over such entities the adoption of this new accounting standard did not impact the company s consolidated financial statements revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications peripherals and service and support contracts the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped for online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the u s and for certain other sales the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware the company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other companies the company generally establishes its own pricing and retains related inventory risk is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its customers and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers accordingly the company generally recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed for sales of third party software applications for iphone ipad and ipod touch ios devices and macs made through the app store and the mac app store the company is not the primary obligor to users of the software and third party developers determine the selling price of their software therefore the company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing only the commission it retains from each sale and including that commission in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations the portion of the sales price paid by users that is remitted by the company to third party developers is not reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations the company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services this includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non software services that are attached to hardware and software products the company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores and also sells gift cards redeemable on the itunes store for the purchase of content and software the company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer revenue from applecare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods applecare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support repair services web based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the company s standard limited warranty the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs including reseller and end user rebates and other sales programs and volume based incentives the estimated cost of these programs is recognized in the period the company has sold the product and committed to a plan the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables for multi element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product s functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product s essential software and undelivered non software services the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe ii third party evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of the selling price esp vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esps reflect the company s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis for sales of iphone ipad apple tv for sales of ipod touch beginning in june and for sales of mac beginning in june the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled with each of these hardware products free of charge to customers essential software for ios devices includes ios and related applications and for mac includes mac os x and ilife in june the company announced it would provide various non software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac the company has identified up to three deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these devices the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of ios devices mac and apple tv to receive on a when and if available basis future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product s essential software the third deliverable is the non software services to be provided to qualifying versions of ios devices and mac the company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for these deliverables the allocation of revenue has been based on the company s esps amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non software services are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated lives of each of these devices which range from to months cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software including estimated warranty costs are recognized at the time of sale costs incurred to provide non software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred the company s process for determining its esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable the company believes its customers particularly consumers would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to ios devices mac and apple tv this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified upgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered the company also believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the non software services because other companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users therefore the company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to the non software services on a standalone basis including those rights and services attached to ios devices mac and apple tv the selling prices would be relatively low key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings market trends for pricing of mac and ios compatible software the company s historical pricing practices the nature of the upgrade rights e g unspecified and when and if available and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product the company may also consider when appropriate the impact of other products and services including advertising services on selling price assumptions when developing and reviewing its esps for software upgrade rights and related deliverables the company may also consider additional factors as appropriate including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist and product specific business objectives when relevant the same factors are considered by the company in developing esps for offerings such as the non software services however the primary consideration in developing esps for the non software services is the estimated cost to provide such services over the estimated life of the related devices including consideration for a reasonable profit margin beginning with the company s june announcement of the upcoming release of the non software services and mac os x lion the company s combined esp for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the right to receive the non software services are as follows for iphone and ipad for ipod touch and for mac the company s esp for the embedded unspecified software upgrade right included with each apple tv is for and for fiscal years prior to amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non software services associated with ios devices and apple tv are recognized on a straight line basis over months and amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non software services associated with macs are recognized on a straight line basis over months the company s esp for the software upgrade right included with each iphone sold beginning with the introduction of iphone in june through the company s second quarter of was beginning in april in conjunction with the company s announcement of ios for iphone the company lowered its esp for the software upgrade right included with each iphone to beginning with initial sales of ipad in april the company s esp for the embedded software upgrade right included with the sale of each ipad is and the company s esp for the embedded software upgrade right included with each ipod touch sold beginning in june is the company accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software related products including the sale of upgrades to previously sold software in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for such transactions revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element and fair value is determined by vsoe if the company cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements the company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements beginning in july the sale of certain upgrades to mac os x and mac versions of ilife include when and if available upgrade rights for which the company does not have vsoe therefore beginning in july the company defers all revenue from the sale of upgrades to the mac os and mac versions of ilife and recognizes it ratably over months shipping costs for all periods presented amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue and the company s shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales warranty expense the company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized the company assesses the adequacy of its pre existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates software development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers in most instances the company s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established therefore costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred the company did not capitalize any software development costs during and in the company capitalized million of costs associated with the development of mac os x version snow leopard mac os x snow leopard which was released during the fourth quarter of the capitalized costs are being amortized to cost of sales on a straight line basis over a three year estimated useful life of the underlying technology total amortization related to capitalized software development costs was million million and million in and respectively advertising costs advertising costs are expensed as incurred advertising expense was million million and million for and respectively share based compensation the company recognizes expense related to share based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments share based compensation cost for restricted stock units rsus is measured based on the closing fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant share based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on each option s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model the company recognizes share based compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight line basis over the requisite service period the company recognizes a benefit from share based compensation in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized in addition the company recognizes the indirect effects of share based compensation on research and development tax credits foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the consolidated statements of operations further information regarding share based compensation can be found in note shareholders equity and share based compensation of this form k income taxes the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement see note income taxes of this form k for additional information earnings per common share basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and unvested rsus the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method an increase in the fair market value of the company s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three years ended september in thousands except net income in millions and per share amounts numerator net income denominator weighted average shares outstanding effect of dilutive securities weighted average diluted shares basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share potentially dilutive securities representing million million and million shares of common stock for and respectively were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these periods because their effect would have been antidilutive financial instruments cash equivalents and marketable securities all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents the company s marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available for sale management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the designations at each balance sheet date the company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short term or long term based on each instrument s underlying contractual maturity date marketable debt securities with maturities of months or less are classified as short term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than months are classified as long term the company classifies its marketable equity securities including mutual funds as either short term or long term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations the company s marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of shareholders equity the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method derivative financial instruments the company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in shareholders equity and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument if any is recognized in current income to receive hedge accounting treatment cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions for options designated as cash flow hedges changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in income for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period the company had no fair value hedges in and the net gain or loss on the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment for forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges the company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness accordingly any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current income derivatives that do not qualify as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through current income allowance for doubtful accounts the company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors the company considers historical experience the age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality of the company s customers current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost computed using the first in first out method or market if the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value the company s inventories consist primarily of components and finished goods for all periods presented property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are stated at cost depreciation is computed by use of the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which for buildings is the lesser of years or the remaining life of the underlying building up to five years for equipment and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements the company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage capitalized costs related to internal use software are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from three to five years depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was billion million and million during and respectively long lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets the company reviews property plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles excluding goodwill for impairment long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if property plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value the company did not record any significant impairments during and the company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired the company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in and the company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit the company amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment the company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods generally ranging between three to seven years fair value measurements the company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the company s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments foreign currency translation and remeasurement the company translates the assets and liabilities of its non u s dollar functional currency subsidiaries into u s dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period revenue and expenses for

company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the company s investment policy requires investments to generally be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio when evaluating the investments for other than temporary impairment the company

whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment s amortized cost basis during and the company did not recognize any significant impairment charges as of september the company does not consider any of its investments to be other than temporarily impaired derivative financial instruments the company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities to help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates certain of the company s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u s dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue the company s subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the u s dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies the company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases generally up to six months to help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company may also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates the company records all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value the company s accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non hedge instruments the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in aoci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item the derivative relates to the company had a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of approximately million and a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of approximately million net of taxes recorded in aoci as of september and september respectively deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized substantially all of the company s hedged transactions as of september are expected to occur within six months derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two month time period deferred gains and losses in aoci associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income and expense unless they are re designated as hedges of other transactions the company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during and the company s unrealized net gains and losses on net investment hedges included in the cumulative translation adjustment account of aoci were not significant as of september and september respectively the ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense the company recognized in other income and expense a net loss of million million and million on foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments during and respectively these amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts the following table summarizes the notional principal amounts of the company s outstanding

notionalprincipal credit riskamounts instruments qualifying as accounting hedges foreign exchange contracts instruments other than accounting hedges foreign exchange contracts the notional principal amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the company s exposure to credit or market loss the credit risk amounts represent the company s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract based on then current currency exchange rates at each respective date the company s gross exposure on these transactions may be further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties the company s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency exchange rates although the table above reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the company s foreign exchange instruments it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge the amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments the company generally enters into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty to further limit credit risk the company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds the company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values as of september the company received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of million which it recorded as accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of

third party intellectual property rights other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third party however the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third party in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third party intellectual property rights the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either september or september the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim however the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and product although most components essential to the company s business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources which subjects the company to significant supply and pricing risks many components that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations in addition the company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company and other participants in the mobile communication and media device and personal computer industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company also uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements substantially all of the company s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are primarily located in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole sourced suppliers of components and manufacturer for many of the company s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to days long term supply agreements the company has entered into long term agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components these agreements generally expire between and as of september the company had a total of billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding of which million are classified as other current assets and billion are classified as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets the company had a total of million of inventory component prepayments

not been fully adjudicated which are discussed in part i item of this form k under the heading legal proceedings and in part i item a under the heading risk factors in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected note
