for more than of net sales in or apple inc form k table of contents competition the markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and the company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business these markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices the company s competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share the company s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry wide downward pressures on gross margins principal competitive factors important to the company include price product features relative price performance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong third party software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation the company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices these markets are highly competitive and include many large well funded and experienced participants the company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the company s products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer these markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses the company s digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peer to peer music and video services the company s future financial condition and operating results depend on the company s ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes the company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware iphone ipad mac and ipod software ios os x and itunes online services and distribution of digital content and applications itunes store app store ibooks store and mac app store some of the company s current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the company s offerings supply of components although most components essential to the company s business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources in addition the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results apple inc form k table of contents while the company manufactures some macs in the united states substantially all of the company s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the company s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to days research and development because the industries in which the company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace the company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through r d licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third party businesses and technology total r d expense was billion billion and billion in and respectively patents trademarks copyrights and licenses the company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services the company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the u s and a number of foreign countries although the company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof the company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel the company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world over time the company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world the company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services no single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the company s products the company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products many of the company s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products processes and services while the company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all because of technological changes in the industries in which the company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the company s products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others from time to time the company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties foreign and domestic operations and geographic data during the company s domestic and international net sales accounted for and respectively of total net sales information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in

geographic data while substantially all of the company s hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia the company also performs final assembly of certain products at its manufacturing facility in ireland the supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in part ii item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and contingencies apple inc form k table of contents business seasonality and product introductions the company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses product introductions can also impact the company s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and often channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction however neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company s future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance warranty the company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products the basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end user the company also offers a day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the company s hardware products in certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute typically at least two years in addition where available consumers may purchase app or ac which extends service coverage on many of the company s hardware products backlog in the company s experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects in particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance employees as of september the company had approximately full time equivalent employees and an additional full time equivalent temporary employees and contractors approximately of the total full time equivalent employees worked in the company s retail segment available information the company s annual report on

operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause the company s actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the company s business financial condition results of operations and stock price because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the company s financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company the company s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and or other factors these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company s products and services demand also could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u s to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the u s dollar other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company s products and services in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets this could have a number of effects on the company s business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and or manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company s products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the company s ability to issue new debt other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments interest rates cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them apple inc form k table of contents global markets for the company s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets the company s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers the company s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services as a result the company must make significant investments in r d the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and or has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks in contrast many of the company s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the company s products and infringing on its intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company s intellectual property the company s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related third party digital content and applications the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the company has a minority market share in the smartphone market additionally the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company s product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third party digital content and applications and with business models that include content provided to users for free some of the company s competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the company because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and or experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions the company s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company s ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using os x which has a minority market share in the personal computer market this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably windows in the market for personal computers and accessories the company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling windows based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins an increasing number of internet enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company s existing products the company s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively apple inc form k table of contents to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp up issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions the company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and value added resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers the company also sells its products and third party products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid sized businesses through its online and retail stores carriers providing cellular network service for iphone typically subsidize users purchases of the device there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions some resellers have perceived the expansion of the company s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the company s products such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the company s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue the financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the company s products or uncertainty regarding demand for the company s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company records a write down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components the company also reviews its long lived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment has occurred it records a write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value although the company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to days because the company s markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments apple inc form k table of contents future operating results depend upon the company s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the company s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components the follow on effects from global economic conditions on the company s suppliers described in global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company above also could affect the company s ability to obtain components therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases the company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries the company s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of whom are located outside of the u s substantially all of the company s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management while these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the company s direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the company s flexibility to respond to changing conditions although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur the company relies on sole sourced outsourcing partners in the u s asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company s hardware products any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company s cost or supply of components or finished goods in addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and man made disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted the company s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company s reputation the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the software s intended operation the company s online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company s reputation apple inc form k table of contents the company relies on access to third party digital content which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content through the itunes store this includes the right to make available music movies tv shows and books currently available through the itunes store the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all some third party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the company s access to or increase the cost of such content the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach failure to obtain the right to make available third party digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results some third party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions if requirements change the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner in addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company s content providers the company s future performance depends in part on support from third party software developers the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third party software applications and services there is no assurance that third party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company s products if third party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company s products customers may choose not to buy the company s products with respect to its mac products the company believes the availability of third party software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the company s products compared to windows based products this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services if the company s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac s prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company s mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market with respect to ios devices the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the app store ios devices are subject to rapid technological change and if third party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change third party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers as with applications for the company s mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the company s ios devices rather than its competitors platforms such as android if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the company s ios devices may suffer the company relies on access to third party intellectual property which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of the company s products include third party intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties based on past experience and industry practice the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms there is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and operating results apple inc form k table of contents the company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future for example technology companies including many of the company s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as the company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase in particular the company s cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the company has significantly increased the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u s jurisdictions and before the u s international trade commission as well as internationally in various countries the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation in management s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the company s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company s business the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas these u s and foreign laws and regulations affect the company s activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing e commerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anti corruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anti competition environmental health and safety apple inc form k table of contents by way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carrier s network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier s network these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks these certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the company from selling certain products compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the company s products and services less attractive to the company s customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the company to change or limit its business practices the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the company s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company s policies and procedures the company s business is subject to the risks of international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations compliance with applicable u s and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anti corruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anti competition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the company s employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company s retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties the company s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the company s more typical retail stores due to the high cost structure associated with the retail segment a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company s control pose risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macro economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the company s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the company s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u s costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the company s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost apple inc form k

future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company s due diligence these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful the company s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic break ins or other events or disruptions system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the company s online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting there may be breaches of the company s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences the company s business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information pii this may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts as with all companies these security measures are subject to third party security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities for example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the company s information technology systems to help protect customers and the company the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders the company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services moreover if a computer security breach affects the company s systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii the company s reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the company s products and services could decrease and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability while the company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self insured

or other parties with whom the company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal state or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties in addition if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs the company s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel much of the company s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its chief executive officer executive team and other highly skilled employees experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in silicon valley where most of the company s key personnel are located the company s business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health

substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations apple inc form k table of contents the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate the company s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels the company s software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company s other products gross margins on the company s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations the company s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners in addition the company s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening u s dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses the company could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lower than anticipated demand for the company s products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the company s logistics components supply or manufacturing partners the company s stock price is subject to volatility the company s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally the company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time the company believes its stock price reflects expectations of future growth and profitability the company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated future dividends are subject to declaration by the company s board of directors and the company s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares if the company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention the company s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u s dollar versus local currencies the company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non u s dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar adversely affects the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings and generally leads the company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the company s products margins on sales of the company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar s strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the u s dollar value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar while generally beneficial to the company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins the company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place apple inc form k table of contents the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio given the global nature of its business the company has both domestic and international investments credit ratings and pricing of the company s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors as a result the value and liquidity of the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially therefore although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen the company distributes its products through third party cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and value added resellers the company also sells its products directly to small and mid sized businesses and education enterprise and government customers a substantial majority of the company s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral third party financing arrangements or credit insurance the company s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited the company also has unsecured vendor non trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub assemblies or assemble final products for the company in addition the company has made prepayments associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components as of september a significant portion of the company s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor non trade receivables and prepayments related to long term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non trade receivables as well as long term prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new u s or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities the company is subject to taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions including ireland where a number of the company s subsidiaries are organized due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change the company s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the u s and ireland for example in june the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in ireland with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the company s irish subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if the european commission were to take a final decision against ireland it could require changes to existing tax rulings that in turn could increase the company s taxes in the future the european commission could also require ireland to recover from the company past taxes reflective of the disallowed state aid the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the

agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in

revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating

subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non software

until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses for the company s other customer incentive programs the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive management s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations valuation and impairment of marketable securities the company s investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the company s consolidated balance sheets changes in the fair value of available for sale securities impact the company s net income only when such securities are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security s cost basis the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other than temporarily impaired which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the company s intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis the company s assessment on whether a security is other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing process equipment including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities in addition the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components the company records a write down for inventories of components and products including third party products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value the company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends the company also reviews its manufacturing related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value apple inc form k table of contents the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional write downs of inventory inventory prepayments and or manufacturing related capital assets these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company s products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company s suppliers that hold any of the company s manufacturing process equipment or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment such write downs would adversely affect the company s results of operations in the period when the write downs were recorded the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled consistent with industry practice the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier purchase commitments typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to days if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products if the company s product development plans change or if there is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products then the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company s typical experience each quarter the company re evaluates these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company s results of operations income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made in addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results apple inc form k table of contents legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i item of this form k under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note commitments and contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies however the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results interest rate risk while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in u s interest rates changes in u s interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the company s debt investments the company s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the company s liquidity requirements the company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio the company typically invests in highly rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment positions as of september a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio as of september a similar basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity apple inc form k table

outstanding with maturities generally less than nine months in the third quarters of and the company issued billion and billion of long term debt respectively the debt issuances included floating and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of billion collectively the notes the company has entered and may enter in the future into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the notes interest rate swaps allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payments into floating rate payments or floating rate payments into fixed rate payments in the third quarter of the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion which effectively converted most of the fixed rate notes into floating rate notes and in the third quarter of the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion which effectively converted the floating rate notes into fixed rate notes as of september a basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the company s debt to increase by million on an annualized basis further details regarding the company s debt is provided in part ii item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note debt foreign currency risk in general the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the u s dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the u s dollar will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in u s dollars there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries the company s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to months however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market conditions forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model based on the results of the model the company estimates with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september compared to a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the company s actual exposures and positions apple inc form k table of contents item financial

that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable the company believes its customers would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights for the essential software included with its qualifying hardware products this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade rights do not obligate the company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered the company also believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the non software services because other companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users therefore the company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to the non software services on a standalone basis including those rights and services attached to ios devices mac and apple tv the selling prices would be relatively low key factors considered by the company in developing the esps for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the company for similar offerings market trends in the pricing of apple branded and third party mac and ios compatible software the nature of the upgrade rights e g unspecified versus specified and the relative esp of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product the company may also consider additional factors as appropriate including the impact of other products and services provided to customers the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist product specific

value in the financial statements on a recurring basis the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the company s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the company s debt instruments and all other financial instruments all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings were valued based on quoted market prices

for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates to help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates certain of the company s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the u s dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue the company s subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the

accrued warranty and indemnification the company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products the basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the

legal claims that the software infringes third party intellectual property rights other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third party however the company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third party in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third party intellectual property rights the company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of september or september the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers under these agreements the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim however the company maintains directors and

concentrations in the available sources of supply of materials and product although most components essential to the company s business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources in addition the company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers therefore many components used by the company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results the company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all therefore the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results substantially all of the company s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in asia a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the company s products although the company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the company s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments the company s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to days other off balance sheet commitments operating leases the company leases various equipment and facilities including retail space under noncancelable operating lease arrangements the company does not currently utilize any other off balance sheet financing arrangements the major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding years and generally contain multi year renewal options leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to years the majority of which are for years and often contain multi year renewal options as of september the company s total future minimum lease payments under

purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier as of september the company had outstanding off balance sheet third party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of billion in addition to the off balance sheet commitments mentioned above the company had outstanding obligations of billion as of september which consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and commitments related to advertising r d internet and telecommunications services and other obligations contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected apple inc v samsung electronics co ltd et al on august a jury
